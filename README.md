# NYC-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes NYC Yellow Taxi trip data to predict passenger tips using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning, and PySpark.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Data preprocessing (cleaning, outlier removal, feature engineering).

EDA with visual insights into fares, trip duration, distance, and payment methods.

Machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, XGBoost, MLP, and AdaBoost.

Distributed processing and modeling using Apache Spark (PySpark MLlib) for scalability.

Web application (Streamlit) for real-time tip prediction with interactive trip parameters.

ðŸ”¹ Highlights:

Best models: MLP Regressor, SVR, Gradient Boosting (high accuracy in tip prediction).

PySpark pipeline improved scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.

Deployed interactive app for live tip estimation.
